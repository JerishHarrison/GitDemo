[9:58:1] New DM Advice Created: Enemy JumperThe enemy managed to leap to your Monty  early in the fight. Enemy units that can reposition like this can bypass your front line, but you can try to plan around it by positioning a Unit less critical to your team such that they are the target instead.
[9:58:1] New DM Advice Created: Focused DownAt the start of combat, a majority of enemies were targeting your Sir Sparkles II. It could be more beneficial to position such that the incoming damage is dispersed between multiple of your Units.
